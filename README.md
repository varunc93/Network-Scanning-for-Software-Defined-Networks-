# Network-Scanning-for-Software-Defined-Networks-
Project for Advanced Computer Network Security at ASU

<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>
Network scanning is one of the first preventive steps that can be taken to prevent security attacks. In this project, scanning was done
on virtual devices present on a software defined network. Opend daylight controller and OpenFlow standard was used to control the network
devices. Two types of scans were provided, a full-scan that used nmap and openvas to identify vulnerabilities on services running on ports,
and to identify filtered/unfiltered ports. The second was a custom scan, where the user is able to filter the scan based on a single IP or IP subnet.
Testing was done using honeypots. The stats of the was different VMs and network was also 
displayed in the final output.
